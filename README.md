# DigiSong

A web based midi program change sequencer for Elektron's Digitakt and Digitone.

## **User Guide**

### ***Background***

The Digitakt and Digitone do not currently have a song mode feature. On top of this,
sequencing program change has some quirks where you have to send any program change
events just before you intend to, as sending it on the click can result in the change
not happening until the end of the next sequence.

DigiSong is an attempt to create a song mode arranger for the Digi's, which allows for
arranging a song from a number of patterns, and compensates for the strangeness around
pattern changes.

Note: any other midi instrument that supports program change could be sequenced from DigiSong.


### ***Usage***

As the tool is web-based, thereâ€™s no need to download any apps, just have a browser that supports web midi.

This means that DigiSong should be useable on any platform, including mobile, which works well with
the latest Digi OS updates DT(1.20) and DN(1.30) which now support USB audo/midi.
